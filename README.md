## Abstract
This project presents the implementation of an interactive suite comprising a Sudoku CSP solver, a Sudoku CSP helper, and two games: Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect4. Initially proposed with a dynamic visual interface and AI functionalities, the final implementation includes:
- A Sudoku solver using the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) methodology.
- A helper tool for Sudoku that dynamically updates cell domains.
- Interactive gameplay for Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect4 with AI opponents.

## Features
### 1. Sudoku CSP Solver
- Solves Sudoku puzzles using a predefined grid and CSP algorithms.
- Employs a backtracking algorithm to ensure the solution satisfies Sudoku's row, column, and subgrid constraints.

### 2. Sudoku CSP Helper
- Dynamically displays possible values for empty cells based on the current grid configuration.
- Updates the domains of all cells in real-time as users input values.

### 3. Tic-Tac-Toe
- **Modes**: 
  - 2-player traditional gameplay.
  - Versus AI mode using the Minimax algorithm.
- AI evaluates all possible moves to choose the most optimal one.

### 4. Connect4
- **Modes**: 
  - 2-player traditional gameplay.
  - Versus AI mode using a heuristic-based Minimax algorithm with a depth of 3 for efficient decision-making.

## Learning Outcomes
- **CSP Principles**: Gained understanding of CSP techniques like variable domains, constraint propagation, and backtracking algorithms.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Hands-on experience with Minimax and heuristics for AI gameplay.
- **Real-Time Interactivity**: Skills in designing tools that dynamically update game states based on user actions.
- **Algorithm Optimization**: Explored techniques like depth-limited Minimax for efficiency.
- **Collaborative Development**: Strengthened teamwork and modular development skills.

## Conclusion and Future Work
The project successfully demonstrates the application of AI in solving structured problems and strategic gameplay. Potential enhancements include:
- Allowing dynamic input for Sudoku puzzles.
- Adding advanced AI strategies like Alpha-Beta pruning for Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect4.
- Introducing difficulty levels for AI.
- Expanding the suite with more AI-driven games and enhanced visualization.
